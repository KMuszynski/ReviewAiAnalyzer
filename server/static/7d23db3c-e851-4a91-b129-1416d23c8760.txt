The new Google pixel might be the best phone ever released. So this is the new Google pixel pro 9 XL and compared to the iPhone 15 or Samsung S24 ultra. This might be the best phone yet and I'm not joking for one, the phone has almost unbeatable personalization, allowing you to make your phone as unique as you can imagine and the overall aesthetic of the phone is just super clean then two, in my opinion, the biggest part about this phone is the 50 megapixel camera and the wide angle camera not only is it amazing quality on the rear camera but even the front camera super clean as well then all of. Just for the price that you can get the pixel for is just crazy. So be honest. You think this is the best phone out right now?
