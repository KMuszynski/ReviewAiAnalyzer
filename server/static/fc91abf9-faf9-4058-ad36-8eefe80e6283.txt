So here it is, the brand new Galaxy S25, not a big difference compared to the previous model. It is 6 grams lighter and you can kind of feel it if you're holding both. You have a faster processor inside, the same battery size, same cameras, the displays kind of equal, but it can do better upscaling. And look, I'm going to review it, but do you want me to compare it to any other phones?
