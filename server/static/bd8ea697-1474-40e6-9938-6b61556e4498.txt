This is the new iPhone 17, Apple's latest rendition of their flagship non pro smartphone. I've had it for around 24 hours. Let's take a closer look. So from a physical design standpoint, if you're familiar with the iPhone 16, it's going to look as though there's almost no changes. You do get some new color choices, like this beautiful lavender, but the more noticeable change is going to be with the display, as it's slightly bigger. Apple accomplished this by reducing the bezel around the screen, which does make for a cleaner and more immersive look. But the most important upgrade around the display is the fact that it finally has. High refresh rate as it's now equipped with Apple Promotion. To say that this is a long time coming is an understatement, but this upgrade makes navigating around iOS noticeably more smooth and enjoyable. Moreover, the iPhone 17 is rocking Apple's new powerhouse, a 19 chip and a healthier battery life. You also get the new 18 megapixel upgraded center stage front selfie camera that allows you to take both portrait and landscape selfies, which is actually pretty great.
